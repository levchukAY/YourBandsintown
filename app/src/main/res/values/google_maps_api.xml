    TODO: Before you run your application, you need a Google Maps API key.

    To get one, follow this link, follow the directions and press "Create" at the end:

    You can also add your credentials to an existing key, using these values:

    Package name:
    09:D9:18:22:44:1A:77:14:8E:4E:5F:13:CF:C1:84:B2:4A:B1:A7:C8

    09:D9:18:22:44:1A:77:14:8E:4E:5F:13:CF:C1:84:B2:4A:B1:A7:C8

    Alternatively, follow the directions here:
    https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/android/start#get-key

    Once you have your key (it starts with "AIza"), replace the "google_maps_key"
    string in this file.
